**Guidelines:**

**For Overall Context (be comprehensive):**
- Include all key decisions, information, and strategic context
- Use bullet points and clear structure
- Cover dependencies between team members
- Note priorities and open questions  
- Be thorough - this is the master context for facilitators
- Include nuances and important details that inform the situation

**For Individual Briefings (be concise):**
- Keep briefings to 2-3 sentences MAX - be concise and scannable
- Focus on what's immediately actionable and relevant to their role
- Questions should be specific and focused (1-2 max)
- Todos only if they clearly emerged from discussion
- Priorities should be one clear, focused sentence
- Make it quick to read and understand at a glance

**CRITICAL: Output ONLY the raw JSON object - no markdown code blocks, no ```json```, no additional text or formatting. Start directly with {{ and end with }}.**"""
