The tool aims to provide support and assistance in these situations. The current discussion is focused on identifying the most crucial components of this idea to define the MVP scope.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Product Idea:** AI follow-up tool for Lovable AI.\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Users with no technical skills face issues after initial \"vibe coding\" of AI projects.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** Provide support and help to resolve these issues.\n*   **Current Focus:** Determine the most important part of the idea to define the MVP.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n*   No decisions have been made yet regarding the MVP scope or specific features.\n\n**Open Questions:**\n\n*   What are the most critical functionalities or features of this AI follow-up tool that constitute a Minimum Viable Product?\n*   What specific types of \"breaks\" or issues will the tool primarily address?\n*   What level of technical assistance will the tool provide (e.g., diagnostic, troubleshooting steps, automated fixes, human support integration)?\n\n**Next Steps & Priorities:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize:** Define the core problem statement and target user segment with greater specificity. This will inform the MVP features.\n2.  **Action:** Konrad (Product Lead) needs to elaborate on the specific pain points and \"breaks\" users experience, and what success looks like for them when using this tool.\n3.  **Action:** Eike (General Consultant) should prepare to provide input on potential solutions, technical feasibility, and market considerations based on Konrad's elaborated problem statement.",
